### Introduction
* Routers are an easy target for hackers but also for security services. Once after a hack a router is often provided 
  with special firmware which will no longer be upgradable. This form of attack is known as "rootkitting".
* RouterSploit is an effective tool against routers. This framework is designed especially for embedded devices. It does 
  not provide a graphical interface and requires the settings to be done manually to execute it against a target. 
* RouterSploit has many exploits and it also supports brute force of various network services. It helps to discover the 
  network components or devices that are unsafe and allow to decide about patch, upgrade or replacement options to fix 
  threats or vulnerabilities. 
* It consist of various modules that aids penetration testing operations, namely:
     - exploits : Modules that take advantage of identified vulnerabilities
     - creds    : Modules designed to test credentials against network services
     - scanners : Modules that check if a target is vulnerable to any exploit 
     - payloads : Modules that are responsible for generating payloads for various architectures and injection points
     - generic  : Modules that perform generic attacks
* RouterSploit has a number of exploits for different router models and have the ability to check whether the remote 
  target is vulnerable before sending off an exploit.

### Introduction
* Maltego is a very powerful open source intelligence (OSINT) tool. 
* It is a unique platform developed by Paterva, to deliver a clear threat picture to the environment that an 
  organization owns and operates. Maltego's unique advantage is to demonstrate the complexity and severity of single 
  points of failure as well as trust relationships that exist currently within the scope of infrastructure.
* It has been mainly designed to harvest information on DNS and whois, and also offers options for search engine 
  querying, SMTP queries etc.
* Maltego can be used for the information gathering phase of all security related work. It will save time and allow to 
  proceed the test with more accuracy.

### Installation, Configuration and Usage Guide
* Maltego uses seed servers by sending client data in the XML format over a secure HTTPS connection. Once processed at 
  the server side, the requested results are returned to the Maltego client.
* Thus, Maltego largely automates the information gathering process, and produces a graphical display of information 
  mined by the software aids.
